      <h2 id="headline">About Richard Stallman</h2>
      <p>Dr. Richard Stallman is the founder of the GNU project and the president of the Free Software Foundation. He began developing GNU in 1984 and has been working on creating freedom-respecting and open source software that is avaliable to the
        public, for free. In 1992, Linus Torvalds liberated his kernel, Linux, which completed the final piece of the GNU project, resulting in the combined GNU/Linux operating system, which is a completely free operating system used by hundreds of
        millions today.</p>
      <p>Stallman personally developed a variety of the free and open source software components of the GNU system, including the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/" target="_self">GNU Compiler Collection</a>, the <a
          href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/gdb.html" target="_self">GNU symbolic debugger</a>, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html" target="_self">GNU Emacs</a>, and various others.</p>
      <p>Stallman invented the concept of <a href="https://gnu.org/licenses/copyleft.html" target="_self">copyleft</a>, "Change it and redistribute it but don't strip off this freedom," and wrote (with lawyers) the <a href="https://gnu.org/licenses/"
          target="_self">GNU General Public License</a>, which implements copyleft. This inspired Creative Commons.</p>
      <p>In 1999, Stallman called for development of a <a href="https://gnu.org/encyclopedia/" target="_self">free online encyclopedia</a> through inviting the public to contribute articles. This idea helped inspire Wikipedia.</p>
